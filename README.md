# cookie.js
An easy way to manage a browser cookie. I guess it's sort of like an Active Record ORM

## Usage
To use it, add `<script src="path/to/cookie.js"></script>` into your html document, then call `var cookie = new Cookie();` and that's it! cookie.js will either fetch an existing cookie or create a blank one
