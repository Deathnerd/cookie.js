# cookie.js
An easy way to manage a browser cookie. I guess it's sort of like an Active Record ORM

## Usage
To use it, add 

```html
<script src="path/to/js.class.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/cookie.js"></script>
``` 
into your html document, then call 
```javascript
var cookie = new Cookie();
``` 
and that's it! cookie.js will either fetch an existing cookie or create a blank one
